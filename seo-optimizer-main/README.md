## How It Works

The application provides a seamless user experience powered by a sophisticated backend process:

1.  **User Input**: The user provides a single main website URL.
2.  **Prompt Generation**: The `geminiService.ts` file constructs a highly detailed prompt and a strict JSON schema. It instructs the AI to first act as a web crawler, simulating a full crawl of the provided domain.
3.  **AI Analysis**: This prompt is sent to the Google Gemini API (`gemini-2.5-flash` model). The model simulates a site crawl and then performs a comprehensive SEO and technical audit based on its findings, adhering strictly to the provided schema.
4.  **Data Parsing**: The application receives the structured JSON response from the API.
5.  **Dynamic Rendering**: The frontend, built with React, parses this JSON data and dynamically renders it across a suite of specialized components, creating the interactive and detailed report dashboard.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini API (`@google/genai`)
- **Charting**: Recharts
- **PDF Generation**: jsPDF, html2canvas

## Setup & Installation

To run this project, you will need a web server to serve the files. Running `index.html` directly from the filesystem (`file://`) will not work due to modern browser security policies regarding ES modules.

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- A local web server. If you have Node.js installed, you can use `npx serve`.

### 1. API Key Configuration

The application requires a Google Gemini API key to function.

**CRITICAL**: This key **must** be configured as an environment variable named `API_KEY` in the execution environment where the application is served. The application is hard-coded to read the key from `process.env.API_KEY`.

**Do not** hard-code your key into any file.

### 2. Running the Application

1.  **Clone/Download the Project**: Place all the project files into a single directory.

2.  **Set the Environment Variable**:
    -   **On macOS/Linux**:
        ```bash
        export API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
        ```
    -   **On Windows (Command Prompt)**:
        ```bash
        set API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
        ```
    -   **On Windows (PowerShell)**:
        ```powershell
        $env:API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
        ```

3.  **Serve the Project Files**: Open your terminal in the project's root directory and run a local server. A simple option is to use the `serve` package:
    ```bash
    # If you don't have 'serve' installed, you can run it directly with npx
    npx serve
    ```

4.  **Access the Application**: The terminal will provide a local URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`). Open this URL in your web browser to use the AI SEO & Performance Analyzer.

## Future Improvements

- **Historical Report Comparison**: Allow users to save analysis snapshots and compare them over time to track progress.
- **On-Page Optimizer Tool**: A dedicated view to analyze a single page against a specific keyword and get line-by-line optimization advice.
- **AI-Generated Meta Tags**: Suggest several optimized meta title and description options for a given page URL.
- **Deeper Backlink Analysis**: Instead of simulation, integrate with an API to pull a sample of real backlinks for analysis.
